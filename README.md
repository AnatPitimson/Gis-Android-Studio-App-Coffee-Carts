## Coffee Carts
### Using Google maps and Firebase

### We've built an app that displays coffee carts throughout the State of Israel.

### If you click on the 'Guest' button, you will be able to see your current location and the locations of the coffee carts throughout the State of Israel displayed on ### the app,

### Clicking on the infowindow will provide you with more information about the selected coffee cart,
### including its operating hours, contact details, and pictures. You can also navigate to the location using Waze and leave a comment. Furthermore, you will see a map displaying hiking trails in the area surrounding the selected coffee cart.

### When using the app, you can register to it and access a list of all coffee carts, add a new cart to the list, and search for a specific cart by its name, area, or address.

### All information, including data about the coffee cart, pictures, comments, and user authentication (register and login), is stored in the Firebase database.
### Specifically, the Realtime Database is used to store data about the coffee carts,
### while Storage is used for pictures.
### Authentication functionality is also integrated through Firebase."
